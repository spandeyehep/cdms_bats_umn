		  Simplified Makefile system for CDMSBATS
		  ---------------------------------------

This file describes an *optional* way to compile the packages that reside within 
cdmsbats. From this directory, users may build any or all of the job stages for 
raw data processing: BatNoise, BatRoot, or BatCalib, along with the BatCommon 
library of shared facilities for all three job stages.  If you are looking to 
install and run the individual packages, please read the BatNoise/README, 
BatRoot/README or BatCalib/README files for full installation instructions 
that will get you started.  Each stage of the processing (BatNoise, BatRoot
and BatCalib) may also be built from within the the package directory.

For users who work with all the stages of processing, or who aren't sure
what they might need to run, everything can be built in one step:

		make all

If you just need one of the executables, you can put the name of the
directory for that stage as the make target:

BatRoot:	make BatRoot
BatNoise:	make BatNoise
BatCalib:	make BatCalib

The executables will be put into the directory BUILD/bin.  In your PATH, you
should add the complete directory path to that directory, which you can do
with one of the following commands, depending on your shell:

TCSH:		setenv PATH ${PATH}:`pwd`/BUILD/bin
BASH:		export PATH=${PATH}:`pwd`/BUILD/bin

----------------------

Note that currently one needs to have ROOT and the BLAS libraries installed
to compile the above executables.
