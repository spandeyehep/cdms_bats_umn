Oct. 2011 - Job configuration and calibration files are subdirectories here:

UserSettings/BatRootSettings	Processing files for BatRoot and BatNoise
UserSettings/BatCalibSettings	Processing files for BatCalib

Notes:

Feb. 2011 - We changed the name of the class RTFTWalkPhonon to VarFreqRTFTWalk.  The change was not propaged to older grid processing files (R123-R130), so if one wants to use those again, be sure to change instances of the name "RTFTWalkPhonon" to "VarFreqRTFTWalk". - LLH
